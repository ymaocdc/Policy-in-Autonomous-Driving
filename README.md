# Paper notes
This repository contains my reading lists and notes on deep learning and machine learning, focus more on **Joint prediction and planning**, **diffusion models** and **Large language models** in autonomous driving.

## About me
My name is [Yunxiang Mao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunxiang-mao-217b35a7/). I have spent years solving large-scale camera perception problems in autonomous driving. Now I am trying to learn more about the downstream in autonomous driving.
